# 22-23-PfDA-Assignment-No.2

***Author: Eva Czeyda-Pommersheim***

## **Introduction**

#### This project has been prepared as the second project assignment for the 2022 Winter Semester Course of HDip in Computing in Data Analytics, Programming for Data Analysis module led by Dr. Brian McGinley at Atlantic Technological University. 

## **Assessment Task on Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) Dataset**

- Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.
- Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and
compare their performance
- Present a statistical analysis of the dataset
- Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using
SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the
parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.
- Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature

## **Environment - System Requirement**<p>
---
This project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook 
which is part of this repository.  

Jupyter Notebook may be run/viewed via several alternative ways.

*Option A - Installation of the necessary 
environment*<p>

In order to run and/or modify the notebook on a 
local machine, the latest version of Python is 
required.  
An easy way to obtained/install python may be 
achieved by downloading the Anaconda open source 
package.  
> **Anaconda** is a distribution of the Python and 
R programming languages for scientific computing, 
that aims to simplify package management and 
deployment.  
The distribution includes data-science packages 
suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
Itâ€™s also is free to install and offers free 
community support.  

Following the installation of Python the Jupyter 
Notebook may be downloaded to the local machine 
from this repository.  
> **Step 1**<p>
Open your preferred command line on your local 
machine (CMDer for Windows and other built-in 
terminals for Linux and Mac OS)<p>
> **Step 2**<p>
>Navigate to the folder where the jupyter notebook 
was downloaded as 
> **Step 3** <p>
> Type command jupyter notebook and press enter 
which should open a new screen with the jupyter 
notebook content.<p>

> **nbviewer** is a web application that lets a URL 
to be entered of a Jupyter Notebook file, it 
renders that notebook as a static HTML web page, 
and gives you stable link to that page which then 
can be shared with others. <p> nbviewer is an open 
source project under the larger Project Jupyter 
initiative along with other projects like Jupyter 
Notebook, JupyterLab, and JupyterHub.<p> The static link to my Jupyter Notebook can be reached by clicking on below link or badge below:<p>
